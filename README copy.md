For this assignment I've focused more on utlizing different Boostrap features and functions on my pages in order to see how they work, rather than the actual appearance of my page at this time. I was curious to see what certain features Bootstrap has and how they would all be responsive together once my work was completed.  The appearance of my page is crude, but I will definitely refine it down the road. 

For the sake of uniformity and organization all my pages have a basic navbar w/ buttons and a Jumbotron.

## About Me
This is my starting page, I basically played around with grid and column placement and it's just meant to give an overview about me professionally and what I do.

## Contact
Probably my most involved page in this assignment.  This page features an email form which is then tied to my email using Javascript and I also included a LinkedIn badge that will connect people to my LI profile.  I in addition to a style sheet for this, I created a mail.php file and some of the features the email includes: Java and PHP validation.

## Portfolio
For the portfolio, I added three columns of cards in a row each one representing work that I plan on doing. I then added a footer bar with several photos. Then just for fun, I linked the easter egg to a meme page just to see if I could.
